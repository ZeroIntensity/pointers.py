# Using Pointers

## Dereferencing

Ok, we know how to create pointers, but they aren't very useful if we only have pointer objects.

Pointers.py has a few different ways to dereference a pointer object. The simplest one is the `Pointer.dereference()` method:

```py
from pointers import Pointer, decay

@decay
def test(ptr: Pointer[str])
    print(ptr.dereference())  # prints "abc"

test("abc")
```

Unfortunately, calling dereference takes a _minimum_ of 15 characters, which can get messy very quickly.

The recommended way to dereference a pointer object is to use the `~` operator, which looks a lot nicer:

```py
@decay
def test(ptr: Pointer[str])
    print(~ptr)  # much shorter and easier to type
```

Finally, you can use the `*` operator, like in low level languages:

```py
@decay
def test(ptr: Pointer[str])
    print(*ptr)  # works the same as above
```

### Why should I use `~` over `*`?

The `~` operator is a **unary operator**, opposed to `*` which is for iterators.

This can cause some issues. For example:

```py
@decay
def test(ptr: Pointer[str])
    deref = ~ptr  # valid, runs correctly
    deref = *ptr  # invalid syntax error!

test("abc")
```

The `*` can also cause issues with iterability of the dereferenced object.

For example, if we have a `list` that we are trying to pass into a function, using the `*` operator steals the iterability:

```py
@decay
def test(ptr: Pointer[list])
    some_func(*ptr)  # this only dereferences it, doesn't splat it
    some_func(**ptr)  # this is treated as a kwarg splat, raises a typeerror

test([1, 2, 3])
```

### Dereference Errors

Dereferencing can fail for a number of reasons, the most common being garbage collection.

Lets take the following code as an example:

```py
from pointers import to_ptr

class test:
    pass

ptr = to_ptr(test())

print(~ptr)  # this causes a DereferenceError, since python collects our instance before this
```

CPython does garbage collection based on reference counting, so you can stop the garbage collection by creating an instance variable, like so:

```py
instance = test()  # this adds to the reference count and stops the collection
ptr = to_ptr(instance)

print(~ptr)  # works just fine, no error
```

However, some types (such as `str` or `int`) are not tracked by the garbage collection, so you don't have to worry about them getting collected.

You can check if the object is tracked by reading the `Pointer.tracked` property:

```py
ptr = to_ptr(test())
ptr_2 = to_ptr("a")

print(ptr.tracked, ptr_2.tracked)  # True False
```

### Segmentation Faults

A segmentation fault occurs when we try to access restricted memory.

This can occur for multiple reasons, but we'll use the following as an example:

```py
from pointers import dereference_address  # internal function used by pointers.py

dereference_address(1)
```

Executing this code results in something like the following:

```
Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault

Current thread 0x00007fb99bffa740 (most recent call first):
  File "[omitted]", line 38 in dereference_address
[1]    424 segmentation fault
```

#### What's happening?

`dereference_address` attempts to read the `PyObject` at address 1, which isn't accessible by Python.

This results in the operating system terminating our program using signal `SIGSEGV`, and the [faulthandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html) module displays the traceback.

## Assignment

If we would like to switch where a pointer is pointing to, we can use the `assign` method:

```py
from pointers import to_ptr

a = to_ptr("a")
b = to_ptr("b")

a.assign(b)
print(~a)  # prints "b", since a is now pointing to the address of b
```

Note that this **does not** change the original value, it only changes what the pointer is looking at.

If you would like to change the original value, please see [movement](movement.md).

### Operator

The `>>` operator can be used instead of calling `assign` manually as well:

```py
from pointers import to_ptr

a = to_ptr("a")
b = to_ptr("b")

a >>= b  # does the same thing as above
```

In fact, we don't even need to create a second pointer when using `>>`.

```py
from pointers import to_ptr

a = to_ptr("a")
a >>= "b"  # works just fine
```

### For C/C++ developers

Pointer assignment is simply just changing what a pointer is looking at. Example:

```cpp
int main() {
    int a = 0; // using an int instead of string
    int b = 0;

    int* ptr = &a;
    ptr = &b; // switches where the pointer is pointing to
    return 0;
}
```

## Frozen Pointers

If you don't want your pointer to ever change, you can use `FrozenPointer` and `to_const_ptr`:

```py
from pointers import to_const_ptr, FrozenPointer

ptr: FrozenPointer[str] = to_const_ptr("abc")
ptr >>= "123"  # pointers.IsFrozenError
```

You can also use it with `decay`:

```py
from pointers import decay, FrozenPointer

@decay
def test(ptr: Pointer[str], ptr2: FrozenPointer[str]):
    ptr >>= "123"  # works just fine
    ptr2 >>= "123"  # pointers.IsFrozenError

test("a", "b")
```
